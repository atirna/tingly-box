# Regression guard for #1662: a freshly `mkdir`ed host directory bind-mounted
# into a Tingly Box image, owned by the invoking host user (not the image's
# non-root "tingly", UID/GID 999), must come up without a manual `chown`.
#
# Runs <image> against exactly that kind of directory and fails if the
# container dies, its logs mention a permission error, or the entrypoint
# never actually writes into the mount (memory/logs/db all nest under it,
# see internal/config/app_config.go).
#
# Usage:
#   docker-smoke-test.sh <image> <container-data-dir>
#
#   <image>              image tag to run, e.g. tingly-box-smoke:build
#   <container-data-dir> bind-mount target inside the container, e.g.
#                        /home/tingly/.tingly-box or /app/.tingly-box

# The entrypoint's `chown -R` reassigns the bind-mounted directory itself
# (not just its contents) to the container's "tingly" (UID/GID 999) — that's
# the fix working as intended, but it also means the *host* user that
# created the directory (this script, when not root) can no longer `ls` or
# `rm` a 0700 dir it no longer owns. Use sudo for anything touching the
# mount after the container has run, same as an operator would.
